# Andre's Dev Portfolio

The second version of my personal website. This project was built with Astro and Vue.js and is hosted on Firebase.

## Screenshots



## Features

Sidebar pushes (rather than overlay) the screen from the right to reveal navigation and social links.

- I saw something similar on [a software engineer's website](https://www.hellomayuko.com) and was inspired to attempt a recreation.

- I made the animated hamburger menu after watching [a video by a favorite CSS Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R00QiudbD4Y&t=1176s&ab_channel=KevinPowell).


Dark and light modes available with on-screen animated toggle.

- I created a pseudo-starfield background for the dark theme. Inspiration was taken from [this awesome portfolio](https://soumyajit.vercel.app/) found [here on GitHub!](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio)


## What I've learned

I discovered that Iconify offers an extensive icon library through the astro-icon integration! No need to scour the web for icons (which is exactly what I had been doing for a very long time). :weary:

- [This video about Iconify] popped up in my feed an hour after I finished. 

Mobile viewports can make responsive web design a nightmare. Choosing the right CSS units ('vw' vs. 'svw' vs. 'dvw', etc.) can be frustrating when, despite your best effort, elements either overflow or come up short. :confounded:

- I reference [this video by another favorite web dev Youtuber](https://youtu.be/5m6JOJLy5B0) often to refresh how the units work.
